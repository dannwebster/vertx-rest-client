/**
 * Represents a client-side REST request.<p>
 * Instances are created by an {@link com.hubrick.vertx.rest.RestClient} instance, via one of the methods corresponding to the
 * specific HTTP methods, or the generic {@link com.hubrick.vertx.rest.RestClient#request} method.<p>
 * Once a request has been obtained, headers can be set on it, and data can be written to its body if required. Once
 * you are ready to send the request, the {@link #end()} method should be called.<p>
 * Nothing is actually sent until the request has been internally assigned an HTTP connection. The {@link com.hubrick.vertx.rest.RestClient}
 * instance will return an instance of this class immediately, even if there are no HTTP connections available in the pool. Any requests
 * sent before a connection is assigned will be queued internally and actually sent when an HTTP connection becomes
 * available from the pool.<p>
 * The headers of the request are actually sent either when the {@link #end()} method is called, or, when the first
 * part of the body is written, whichever occurs first.<p>
 * This class supports both chunked and non-chunked HTTP.<p>
